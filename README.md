# Two-stages-Miller-compensated-OTA
In this project we use the 65 nm cadence virtuoso tool to test the pre-layout and post-layout simulation for the two stages Miller compensated OTA with the first stage differential input and single ended output while the second stage is common source with active load, we are required to satisfy certain certain specifications regard the OP-Amp.
